### Creating items

You must first define the items that will appear in your story. They are defined in the configuration of your story. In Twine 2, in the view of your passages, click on the name of your story in the bottom-left of the screen then click on `Edit Story Javascript`. In it, you can put, for example:

```js
window.config = {
    "items": [
        {
            "tag": "sword",
            "name": "Steel Sword",
            "x": 1, "y": 107
        },
        {
            "tag": "shield",
            "name": "Shield",
            "x": 2, "y": 71
        },
        {
            "tag": "red-potion",
            "name": "Health Potion",
            "x": 4, "y": 41
        }
    ]
}
```

The `tag` field is the "programming" name you will use in other function calls, you should only use lowercase alphanumeric characters and use `-` instead of whitespace. The `name` field is the "pretty" name that will be displayed in-game.

`x` and `y` represents the coordinates of the item in the spritesheet. You can use the [item-chooser]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-08-07-item-chooser %}) to find the coordinate of a specific sprite.

You can add as many items as you want (don't forget the trailing `,` after each item's closing `}`).

### Handling items in-game

All the functions use the `tag` of items, defined in the configuration, to reference them.

Using the configuration above, to add a `sword` to the player's inventory, we'd write:

```javascript
<%
character.inventory.addItem("sword"); // Give a sword to the player
%>
```

You can also spawn items in a small chest under the content of the passage. Those items will be draggable by the player to their inventory.

```javascript
<%
// Those two lines will spawn one chest with two items:
// a sword and a shield
story.addLootItem("sword");
story.addLootItem("shield");
%>
```
