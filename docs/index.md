### What is Adventure

**Adventures** is a custom story format for [Twine 2](https://twinery.org/) that allows writers to add RPG elements such as health, items, golds and more to their story.

### Requirements

**Adventures** is based on [klembot's Snowman 2](https://bitbucket.org/klembot/snowman-2) and uses Javascript to interact with the state of the game.

It is recommended to know a bit of Javascript, but it is not mandatory. Most function calls are easily understandable and can be copy/pasted from the docs.
